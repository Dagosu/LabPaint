### Game Description

LabPaint is a 2D game in which the player controls a scientist. The goal of the game is to kill the slimes which were created after a failed experiment by painting the floor in the colors of the slimes. They spawn randomly across the map. If a slime touches the wrong color, it becomes bigger and stronger. The game ends when the player dies. The score can be saved in a ranking table.
